The \emph{finite (fractional) expansion\/} of a structure $M$ is a many-sorted expansion that has a sort for $M$, which we call the home-sort, a sort for $\RR$, the set of real numbers, and a sort for the finite fractional multisets of elements of $M^n$, for any $n<\omega$.
%
A \emph{(fractional) multiset\/} is a function $s:M^n\to\RR^+\cup\{0\}$.
%
We say that $s$ is \emph{finite\/} if it is almost always $0$.
%
We interpret $s(a)$ as the number of occurreces of $a$ in $s$.
%
For this reason, we use the following suggestive notation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] \ceq{\hfill\emph{$a\in s$}\vphantom{\sum_x} }
  {=}
  {s(a)}\hfill  this is called the  \emph{multiplicity\/} of $a$ in $s$;
  \item[2.] \ceq{\hfill\emph{$|s|$} }
  {=}
  {\sum_{a\in M} a\in s}\hfill  this is called the  \emph{size\/} of $s$;
  \item[3.] 
  \ceq{\hfill\emph{$\big|\big\{a\in s\ :\ \phi(a\,;b)\big\}\big|$} }
  {=}
  {\sum_{a\,\models\phi(x;b)} a\in s}
\end{itemize}

We call these multisets \emph{samples\/} of $M^n$.

We will write \emph{$M^{\rm f}$\/} for the expansion above.
%
The language of $M^{\rm f}$ is denoted by \emph{$L^{\rm f}$.}
%
It expands $L$ and the language of arithmetic.
%
Moreover, $L^{\rm f}$ has a symbols for the functions in \ssf{1}-\ssf{3} above.
%
In particular, claim \ssf{3} requires a symbol for every $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$.


%For ease of exposition we may also use rational numbers, though these need not have their own sort as they are interpretable in the naturar numbers.

Let $\U$ be a monster model of cardinality $\kappa$, an inaccessible cardinal larger than the cardinality of $L$.
%
The \emph{hyperfinite expansion\/} of $\U$ is a saturated elementary extension of $\U^{\rm f}$ of cardinality $\kappa$.
%
We will write \emph{$\U^{\rm f*}$\/} for this expansion.
%
As all saturated models of cardinality $\kappa$ are isomorphic, we can assume that $\U$ is the home-sort of $\U^{\rm f*}$.

 We write \emph{$\supp(s)$\/} for the \emph{support\/} of $s$, that is, the subset of $\U^n$ where $x\in s$ is positive. Note that $\supp(s)$ is a definable subset of $\U^n$, hence its cardinality is either finite of $\kappa$. Moreover, $s\subseteq\M^n$ for some small model $M$, then $\supp(s)$ is finite.
 
 If $s$ is a sample in $\U^{\rm f*}$, we write \emph{$s\subseteq\U^n$\/} as a shorthand of $\supp(s)\subseteq\U^n$.

% \begin{definition}[???]
%   We say that $\U$ is \emph{pseudofinite\/} every definable set is the support of a sample.\QED
% \end{definition}

\begin{fact}
  Every model $M$ is the domain of the home-sort of some $M^{\rm f}\preceq\U^{\rm f*}$.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  Difficile da scrivere senza hand-waving.
  % Suppose  $\U^{\rm f*}\models \E x\,\phi(x)$.
  % %
  % Every formula with parameters in $M^{\rm f}$ is equivalent to a formula with parameters in $M$.  
\end{proof}

Let $s\subseteq\U^{|x|}$ be a sample.
%
For every formula $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$ and every $b\in\U^{|z|}$ we define

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_{s}\,\phi(x\,;b)$} }
{=}
{\frac{\big|\big\{a\in s\ :\ \phi(a\,;b)\big\}\big|}
{|s|}},

%
%If we pretend that hyperrational are elements of $\U^{\rm f*}$, then $\Av_{s}\,\phi(x\,;b)$, as a function of $s$ and $b$, is definable in $\U^{\rm f*}$. 

Below, $\epsilon$ always ranges over the positive standard reals.
%
If $a$ and $b$ are hyperreals, we write \emph{$a\approx_\epsilon b$\/} for $|a-b|<\epsilon$.
%
We write \emph{$a\approx b$\/} if $a\approx_\epsilon b$ holds for every $\epsilon$.
%
%If $\mu$ is a real number we write $a\approx_\epsilon \mu$ if there is a standard rational $b\approx_{\epsilon/2} a$ such that $|b-\mu|<\epsilon/2$ (this last inequality is evaluated in the standard real line). 
%
We write $\st(a)$, for the standard part of the hyperrational number $a$.
%
That is, the unique real number $\mu$ such that $\mu\approx a$. 

The standard part of $\Av_s$ induces a finite probability measure on the algebra of definable subsets of $\U^{|x|}$.
%
This measure has an unique extension to a Lebesgue probability measure on a $\sigma$-algebra.
%
This is known as the \emph{Loeb measure.}

\begin{lemma}
  For every formula $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$, every sample $s\subseteq\U^{|x|}$ and every infinite $B\subseteq\U^{|z|}$ such that $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b)\not\approx0$ for every $b\in B$, there is a finite cover $B_1,\dots, B_n$ of $B$ such that the types $\{\phi(x\,;b):b\in B_i\}$ are consistent.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $M^{\rm f*}\preceq\U^{\rm f*}$ be a sufficiently saturated model such that $B\subseteq M^{|z|}$. Define  for every $\epsilon$
  
  \ceq{\hfill B_\epsilon}{=}{\Big\{b\in B\ :\ \Av_s\phi(x\,;b)>\epsilon\Big\}.}

Define also

  \ceq{\hfill p_\epsilon(w)}{=}{\Big\{\Av_w\phi(x\,;b)>\epsilon :\ b\in B_\epsilon\Big\}.}

By saturation there is an $s'\in M^{\rm f*}$ that realises the union of all these types. As $s'\subseteq M^{|x|}$ then $\supp(s')$ is finite. Clearly, we can assume that $a\in s'$ is standard for all $a$. So the claim follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Let  $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$ be a nip formula.
  %
  %Let $\M\preceq\U$ (there is no requirement on the cardinality of $\M$).
  %
  Let $M$ be a model.
  %
  For every sample $s\subseteq\U^{|x|}$, and every $\epsilon$, there is a sample $s_{M,\epsilon}\subseteq M^{|x|}$ such that $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b)\approx_\epsilon\Av_{s_{M,\epsilon}}\,\phi(x\,;b)$ for all $b\in M^{|z|}$.
  
  Moreover, the cardinality of $s_{M,\epsilon}$ soley depends on $\epsilon$, namely

  \ceq{\hfill |s_{M,\epsilon}|}{\le}{c\,\frac{k}{\epsilon^{\scriptscriptstyle 2}}\ln\frac k\epsilon}

  where $c$ is an absolute constant.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Questo √® Vapnik-Chervonenkis.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[???]
  When the model $M$ in the theorem above is sufficiently (?) saturated, we can claim that there is a (necessarily finite) sample $s_M\subseteq M^{|x|}$ such that $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b)\approx\Av_{s_M}\,\phi(x\,;b)$.\QED
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  Let  $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$.
  %
  We say that the sample $s\subseteq\U^{|x|}$ is \emph{invariant\/} for $\phi(x\,;z)$ over $A$ if, for every $s'\equiv_As$ and every $b\in\U^{|z|}$, we have $\Av_s\,\phi(x\,;b)\approx\Av_{s'}\,\phi(x\,;b)$.\QED
\end{definition}

For invariant samples the Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theorem can be strengthened as follows.

\begin{corollary}
  Let  $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$ be a nip formula.
  %
  Let $M$ be any model.
  %
  For every sample $s\subseteq\U^{|x|}$ that is invariant for $\phi(x\,;z)$ over $M$, and every $\epsilon$, there is a sample $s_{M,\epsilon}\subseteq M^{|x|}$ such that $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b)\approx_\epsilon\Av_{s_{M,\epsilon}}\,\phi(x\,;b)$ for all $b\in\U^{|z|}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  By the theorem above, there is a sample $s_{M,\epsilon}\subseteq M^{|x|}$ such that $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b)\approx_\epsilon\Av_{s_{M,\epsilon}}\,\phi(x\,;b)$ for all $b\in M^{|z|}$.
  
  Suppose for a contradiction that $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b')\not\approx_\epsilon\Av_{s_{M,\epsilon}}\,\phi(x\,;b')$ for some $b'\in\U^{|z|}$.
  %
  Pick a sample $s'\subseteq\U^{|x|}$ such that $b'\cnonfork_{M}s'\equiv_Ms$.
  %
  By invariance, $\Av_{s'}\phi(x\,;b')\not\approx_\epsilon\Av_{s_{M,\epsilon}}\,\phi(x\,;b')$.
  %
  As $b'\cnonfork_{M}s'$, the same formula holds for some $b\in M^{|z|}$.
  %
  Once again by invariance, $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b)\not\approx_\epsilon\Av_{s_{M,\epsilon}}\,\phi(x\,;b)$.
  %
  A contradiction.
\end{proof}

The following is stronger form of invariance.


\begin{definition}[???]
  % Let  $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$.
  %
  %We say that a sample $s$ of $M^{|x|}$ is $\phi$-smooth over $M$ if there is a finite $S\subseteq M^{|x|}$ such that $\Av_s\,\phi(x\,;b)\approx\Av_S\,\phi(x\,;b)$ for all $b\in M^{|z|}$.
  We say that a sample $s\subseteq\U^{|x|}$ is \emph{smooth\/} for $\phi(x\,;z)$ over $M$ if for any other sample $s'$ such that $\Av_s\,\phi(x\,;b)\approx\Av_{s'}\,\phi(x\,;b)$ for all $b\in M^{|z|}$, the same equivalence holds for all $b\in\U^{|z|}$.\QED
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[???]
  A sample $s\subseteq\U^{|x|}$ is \emph{finitely satisfiable\/} for $\phi(x\,;z)$ in $M$ if, for every $b\in\U^{|z|}$ such that $\Av_s\phi(x\,;b)\not\approx0$, there is  $a\in M^{|z|}$ such that $\phi(a\,;b)$.
  
  We say that $s$ is \emph{generically stable\/} for $\phi(x\,;z)$ over $M$ if it is both invariant and finitely satisfiable for $\phi(x\,;z)$ over $M$.\QED
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[???]
  A formula $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$ is \emph{distal\/} if there is a formula $\psi(x\,;z_1,\dots z_n)\in L$ such that for every finite sample $s$ and every $b\in\U^{|x|}$ there are $a_1,\dots,a_n\in s^{|z|}$ such that $\psi(x\,;a_1,\dots,a_n)\iff p(x)$, where $p(x)=\tp_\phi(b/....s)$.\QED
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[(false)]
  The following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$ is distal;
    \item[2.] if $s$ is generically stable for $\phi(x\,;z)$ over $M$ then $s$ is smooth for $\phi(x\,;z)$ over $M$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\section{Uniform samples}\label{samples}
We call $\U$ the domain of the home sort. This curries all the structure. The domain of the second sort, 

Fix a tuple of variables $x$ and let $\bar x=\<x_i:i<\omega\>$, where $|x_i|=|x|$.
%
For $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ and $\psi(x)\in L(\U)$ we define ($n>1$)

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\psi(x)$} }
{=}
{\frac1n\Big|\big\{i<n\ :\ p(\bar x)\proves\psi(x_i)\big\}\Big|}

If $p(\bar x)$ is the type containing $\b ar x=\bar a$ for some $\bar a\in \U^{|x|\cdot\omega}$,
we write \emph{$\Av_{\bar a{\restriction n}}\,\psi(x)$.}

\begin{definition}
  We say that $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ is a \emph{sample\/}
  if the limit below exists for every formula $\psi(x)\in L(\U)$.

  \ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_p\,\psi(x)$}}{=}{\lim_{n\to\infty}\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\psi(x).}

  Let $\phi(x,z)\in L$ be given. We say that $p(\bar x)$ is a \emph{$\phi$-sample\/} 
  if the formula $\psi(x)$ above is restricted to range over those of the form $\phi(x,b)$ 
  for $b\in\U^{|z|}$.

  We say that $p(\bar x)$ is a \emph{uniform $\phi$-sample\/} if it is a sample and 
  for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a $k$ such that $\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x,b)$ 
  is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av_p\,\phi(x,b)$ for all $n>k$ and $b\in\U^{|z|}$.

  We say that $p(\bar x)$ is a \emph{uniform sample\/} if it is a uniform 
  $\phi$-sample for all $\phi(x,z)\in L$.\QED
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ be a sample finitely satisfied in $M$.
  %
  Let $q(x)\in S(M)$.

  Then for every formula $\phi(x)\in L(\U)$ either 
  
  \hfil$\displaystyle\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\big(\psi(x)\wedge\phi(x)\big)\ :\ \psi(x)\in q\Big\}$
  
  is either $0$ or $\Av_p\,\phi(x)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  As $p(\bar x)$ is finitely satisfied in $M$ there is a tuple in $\bar a\in M^{|x|\cdot n}$
  such that $\Av_{\bar a}\,\big(\psi(x)\wedge\phi(x)\big)$ is within $\epsilon$ form the 
  infimum above.
\end{proof}

Define

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)$}}
{=}
{\inf\Big\{\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\psi(x)\ :\ \psi(x)\in q\Big\}}

Clearly the infimum above is attained.

\begin{proposition}
      If $p(\bar x)$ is a sample and $q(x)\subseteq L(\U)$, then
      
      \ceq{\hfill\lim_{n\to\infty}\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)}
      {=}
      {\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\phi(x)\ :\ \phi(x)\in q\Big\}}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
      Fix $\epsilon>0$.
      %
      Let $\phi(x)\in q$ be such that $\Av_p\,\phi(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ from the infimum above.
      %
      Let $k$ be such that $\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ from  $\Av_p\,\phi(x)$ for every $n>k$.
      %
      Then, for every $n>k$,

      \ceq{\hfill\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)}
      {\le}
      {\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x)}

      \ceq{}
      {\le}
      {\Av_p\,\phi(x) + \epsilon}

      \ceq{}
      {\le}
      {\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\phi(x)\ :\ \phi(x)\in q\Big\} + 2\epsilon}

      For the converse inequality we inductively pick a sequence of integers $n_i$ and formulas $\psi_i(x)\in q$ as follows.
      %
      Let $n_0=1$ and $\psi_i(x)$ such that $\Av_{p\restriction {n_i}}\,\psi_i(x)=\Av_{p\restriction {n_i}}\,q(x)$.
      %
      Then $n_{i+1}$ be such that $\Av_p\,\psi_i(x)\le\Av_{p\restriction {n_{i+1}}}\,\psi_i(x)+\epsilon$.
      %
      Then

      \ceq{\hfill\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\phi(x)\ :\ \phi(x)\in q\Big\}}
      {\le}
      {\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\psi_i(x)\ :\ i<\omega\Big\}}

      \ceq{}
      {\le}
      {\inf\Big\{\Av_{p\restriction {n_{i+1}}}\,\psi_i(x)\ :\ i<\omega\Big\} + \epsilon}
      % {\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x) + \epsilon}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
      Let $p(\bar x)$ be a sample finitely satisfied in $M$.
      %
      Let $q'(x)=q(x)\cup\{\phi(x)\}$ for $q(x)\in S(M)$ and $\phi(x)\in L(\U)$.
      %
      Then $\Av_p\,q'(x)$ is either $0$ or $1$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Under the assumptions of the corollary, for every $\epsilon>0$ there is an $n$ and a tuple $\bar a\in M^{|x|\cdot\omega}$ such that $\Av_{\bar a{\restriction n}}\,q'(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av_p\,q'(x)$. As $\Av_{\bar a{\restriction n}}\,q'(x)$
\end{proof}



\begin{proposition}
      Let $\bar x=\<x_i:i<\omega\>$ and $|x_i|=|x|$ and let $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$.
      %  
      Then the following are equivalent 
      \begin{itemize}
            \item[1.] $p(\bar x)$ is a uniform global sample;
            \item[2.] for every $\epsilon>0$, there is an $n$ and a formula $\theta(\bar x)\in p$ such that $\Av_n\big(\bar a;\phi(x,b)\big)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av_p\phi(x,b)$ for all $b\in\U^{|z|}$ and all $\bar a\models\theta(\bar x)$.
      \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
???
\end{proof}

Vale anche/solo/nemmeno la versione non uniforme della proposizione?

Note that, if $p(\bar x)$ is definable, say over $M$, then there is a formula $\psi_{m/n}(z)\in L(M)$ such that

\ceq{\hfill\psi_{m/n}(z)}{\IFF}{\Av_n\big(p(\bar x);\phi(x,z)\big)=\frac{m}{n}.}
