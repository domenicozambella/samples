Fix a tuple of variables $x$ and let $\bar x=\<x_i:i<\omega\>$, where $|x_i|=|x|$.
%
For $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ and $q(x)\subseteq L(\U)$ we define

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)$}}{=}{\frac1n\Big|\big\{i<n\ :\ p(\bar x)\proves q(x_i)\big\}\Big|}

If $p(\bar x)$ is the type containing $\bar x=\bar a$ for some $\bar a\in \U^{|x|\cdot\omega}$, we write \emph{$\Av_{\bar a{\restriction n}}\,q(x)$.} 

\begin{definition}
      We say that $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ is a \emph{global sample\/} if the limit below exists for every formula $\phi(x)\in L(\U)$.

      \ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_p\,\phi(x)$}}{=}{\lim_{n\to\infty}\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x).}\QED
\end{definition}

Qualche esempio in cui il limite non esiste?

\begin{proposition}
      If $p(\bar x)$ is a global sample, then $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)$ exists for any $q(x)\subseteq L(\U)$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
      ???
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
      Let $\bar x=\<x_i:i<\omega\>$ and $|x_i|=|x|$.
      %
      We say that the type $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ is a \emph{uniform global sample\/} if it is a global sample and for every $\phi(x,z)\in L$, every $b\in\U^{|z|}$, and every $\epsilon>0$, there is an $n$ such that $\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x,b)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av_p\,\phi(x,b)$ for all $b\in\U^{|z|}$.\QED
\end{definition}

Qualche esempio in cui l'uniformit√† √® rilevante?

\begin{proposition}
      Let $\bar x=\<x_i:i<\omega\>$ and $|x_i|=|x|$ and let $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$.
      %  
      Then the following are equivalent 
      \begin{itemize}
            \item[1.] $p(\bar x)$ is a uniform global sample;
            \item[2.] for every $\epsilon>0$, there is an $n$ and a formula $\theta(\bar x)\in p$ such that $\Av_n\big(\bar a;\phi(x,b)\big)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av\big(p;\phi(x,b)\big)$ for all $b\in\U^{|z|}$ and all $\bar a\models\theta(\bar x)$.
      \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
???
\end{proof}

Note that, if $p(\bar x)$ is definable, say over $M$, then there is a formula $\psi_{m/n}(z)\in L(M)$ such that

\ceq{\hfill\psi_{m/n}(z)}{\IFF}{\Av_n\big(p(\bar x);\phi(x,z)\big)=\frac{m}{n}.}

Assume that $p(\bar x)$ is a global sample finitely satisfied in $M$.
%
Then, under the assumptions of the proposition above, for every $\epsilon>0$ there is an $n$ and a tuple $\bar a\in M^{|x|\cdot n}$ such that $\Av_n\big(\bar a;\phi(x,b)\big)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av\big(p;\phi(x,b)\big)$ for all $b\in\U^{|z|}$.

Let $p(\bar x)$ be as above.
%
Let $q'(x)=q(x)\cup\{\phi(x)\}$ for some $q(x)\in S(M)$ and $\phi(x)\in L(\U)$.
%
Then $\Av\big(p;q'(x)\big)$ exists and is either $0$ or $1$.
