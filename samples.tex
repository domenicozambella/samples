Fix a tuple of variables $x$ and let $\bar x=\<x_i:i<\omega\>$, where $|x_i|=|x|$.
%
For $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ and $\psi(x)\in L(\U)$ we define ($n>1$)

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\psi(x)$}}{=}{\frac1n\Big|\big\{i<n\ :\ p(\bar x)\proves\psi(x_i)\big\}\Big|}

If $p(\bar x)$ is the type containing $\bar x=\bar a$ for some $\bar a\in \U^{|x|\cdot\omega}$, we write \emph{$\Av_{\bar a{\restriction n}}\,\psi(x)$.} 

\begin{definition}
We say that $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$ is a \emph{sample\/} if the limit below exists for every formula $\psi(x)\in L(\U)$.

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_p\,\psi(x)$}}{=}{\lim_{n\to\infty}\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\psi(x).}

Let $\phi(x,z)\in L$ be given. We say that $p(\bar x)$ is a \emph{$\phi$-sample\/} if the formula $\psi(x)$ above is restricted to range over those of the form $\phi(x,b)$ for $b\in\U^{|z|}$.

We say that $p(\bar x)$ is a \emph{uniform $\phi$-sample\/} if it is a sample and for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a $k$ such that $\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x,b)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av_p\,\phi(x,b)$ for all $n>k$ and $b\in\U^{|z|}$.

We say that $p(\bar x)$ is a \emph{uniform sample\/} if it is a  uniform $\phi$-sample for all $\phi(x,z)\in L$.\QED
\end{definition}
Define

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)$}}
{=}
{\inf\Big\{\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\psi(x)\ :\ \psi(x)\in q\Big\}}

Clearly the infimum above is attained.

\begin{proposition}
      If $p(\bar x)$ is a sample and $q(x)\subseteq L(\U)$, then
      
      \ceq{\hfill\lim_{n\to\infty}\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)}
      {=}
      {\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\phi(x)\ :\ \phi(x)\in q\Big\}}
      
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
      Fix $\epsilon>0$.
      %
      Let $\phi(x)\in q$ be such that $\Av_p\,\phi(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ from the infimum above.
      %
      Let $k$ be such that $\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ from  $\Av_p\,\phi(x)$ for every $n>k$.
      %
      Then, for every $n>k$,

      \ceq{\hfill\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x)}
      {\le}
      {\Av_{p\restriction n}\,\phi(x)}

      \ceq{}
      {\le}
      {\Av_p\,\phi(x) + \epsilon}

      \ceq{}
      {\le}
      {\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\phi(x)\ :\ \phi(x)\in q\Big\} + 2\epsilon}

      For the converse inequality we pick a sequence of integers $n_i$ a formula  $\psi_i(x)\in q$ as follows. Start with $n_0=1$ and $\psi_0=\top$. Then, inductively let $n_{i+1}$ be such that $\Av_{p\restriction {n_{i+1}}}\,q(x)\le\Av_p\,\psi_i(x)+\epsilon$. Let  $\Av_{p\restriction {n_{i+1}}}\,\psi_i(x)=\Av_{p\restriction {n_{i+1}}}\,q(x)$.
      
      
      such that $\Av_{p\restriction {n_i}}\,\psi_i(x)=\Av_{p\restriction {n_i}}\,q(x)$.
      %
      We can also require that $\Av_{p\restriction {n_{i+1}}}\,\psi_{i+1}(x)\le\Av_p\,\psi_i(x)+\epsilon$.
      %
      In fact, first chose $n_{i+1}$ such that $\Av_{p\restriction {n_{i+1}}}\,q(x)\le\Av_p\,\psi_i(x)+\epsilon$ then 
      
      Then for all $n$

      \ceq{\hfill\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\phi(x)\ :\ \phi(x)\in q\Big\}}
      {\le}
      {\inf\Big\{\Av_p\,\psi_n(x)\ :\ n<\omega\Big\}}

      \ceq{}
      {\le}
      {\Av_{p\restriction n}\,q(x) - \epsilon}
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}
      Let $p(\bar x)$ be a sample finitely satisfied in $M$.
      %
      Let $q'(x)=q(x)\cup\{\phi(x)\}$ for $q(x)\in S(M)$ and $\phi(x)\in L(\U)$.
      %
      Then $\Av_p\,q'(x)$ is either $0$ or $1$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Under the assumptions of the corollary, for every $\epsilon>0$ there is an $n$ and a tuple $\bar a\in M^{|x|\cdot\omega}$ such that $\Av_{\bar a{\restriction n}}\,q'(x)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av_p\,q'(x)$. As $\Av_{\bar a{\restriction n}}\,q'(x)$
\end{proof}




\begin{proposition}
      Let $\bar x=\<x_i:i<\omega\>$ and $|x_i|=|x|$ and let $p(\bar x)\in S(\U)$.
      %  
      Then the following are equivalent 
      \begin{itemize}
            \item[1.] $p(\bar x)$ is a uniform global sample;
            \item[2.] for every $\epsilon>0$, there is an $n$ and a formula $\theta(\bar x)\in p$ such that $\Av_n\big(\bar a;\phi(x,b)\big)$ is within $\epsilon$ from $\Av_p\phi(x,b)$ for all $b\in\U^{|z|}$ and all $\bar a\models\theta(\bar x)$.
      \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
???
\end{proof}

Vale anche/solo/nemmeno la versione non uniforme della proposizione?

Note that, if $p(\bar x)$ is definable, say over $M$, then there is a formula $\psi_{m/n}(z)\in L(M)$ such that

\ceq{\hfill\psi_{m/n}(z)}{\IFF}{\Av_n\big(p(\bar x);\phi(x,z)\big)=\frac{m}{n}.}
